Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Practice Skills

- Creative feature engineering 
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

## Goal

- It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

- Submission File Format
The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```csv
Id,SalePrice
1461,169000.1
1462,187724.1233
1463,175221
```
