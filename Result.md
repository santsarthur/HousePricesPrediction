# Results

This project was submitted to a Kaggle competition, where the evaluation was carried out directly on the platform. The model achieved a score of 0.25476, calculated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). In this context, a lower score indicates better predictive accuracy, meaning the model was able to estimate house prices with a relatively low average error â€” a promising result for an early-stage project.

As one of my first end-to-end machine learning projects, it was a valuable hands-on experience where I applied essential concepts such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. I explored different regression algorithms, including Regression Trees, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), analyzing their behavior and performance.

All development steps are thoroughly documented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook, with detailed explanations written in my native language (Brazilian Portuguese). Each section includes comments that explain the reasoning behind every decision, making the full workflow transparent and educational.
