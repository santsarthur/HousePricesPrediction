# 📊 Results

This project was submitted to a **Kaggle competition**, where the evaluation was performed directly on the platform. My model achieved a score of **0.25476**, calculated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

### 📉 Model Performance
In this context:
- **A lower score** indicates better predictive accuracy.
- The achieved score means the model was able to estimate house prices with a relatively low average error, which is a **promising result** for an early-stage project.

### 🛠️ Key Learnings
As one of my first **end-to-end machine learning projects**, this was a valuable hands-on experience where I applied and deepened my understanding of essential machine learning concepts:
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Model Training and Evaluation**

### 🤖 Algorithms Explored
I experimented with multiple regression models, including:
- **Regression Trees**
- **Decision Trees**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

I analyzed the behavior of each model and evaluated their performance to determine the most effective approach for this task.

### 📚 Documentation
All development steps are thoroughly documented in the accompanying **Jupyter Notebook**, with **detailed explanations** written in **Brazilian Portuguese**. Each section includes comments explaining the rationale behind every decision, making the entire workflow transparent and educational.
